Whispered something in your ear Cuvinte 5, Vocale 11
It was a perverted thing to say Cuvinte 7, Vocale 9
But I said it anyway Cuvinte 5, Vocale 7
Made you smile and look away Cuvinte 6, Vocale 11
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby Cuvinte 5, Vocale 8
As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine Cuvinte 10, Vocale 14
NOTHING'S GONNA HURT YOU, BABY Cuvinte 5, Vocale 8
Nothing's gonna take you from my side Cuvinte 7, Vocale 11
When we dance in my living room Cuvinte 7, Vocale 9
To that silly '90s R&B Cuvinte 5, Vocale 3
When we have a drink or three Cuvinte 7, Vocale 9
Always ends in a hazy shower scene Cuvinte 7, Vocale 10
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby Cuvinte 5, Vocale 8
As long as you're with me, you'll be just fine Cuvinte 10, Vocale 14
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby Cuvinte 5, Vocale 8
Nothing's gonna take you from my side Cuvinte 7, Vocale 11
And we laugh into the microphone and sing Cuvinte 8, Vocale 13 *
With our sunglasses on, to our favorite songs Cuvinte 8, Vocale 15
And we're laughing in the microphone and singing Cuvinte 8, Vocale 15 *
With our sunglasses on, to our favorite songs Cuvinte 8, Vocale 15
Nothing's gonna hurt you, baby Cuvinte 5, Vocale 8
Nothing's gonna take you from my side Cuvinte 7, Vocale 11
